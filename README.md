# WebViewBundle
WebViewBundle is a lightweight Delphi framework that lets you package HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets into a single executable using the WebView2 engine. It works by embedding a ZIP-packed virtual file system directly into your EXE, and serves it using WebView2's virtual host mappingâ€”no server, no installer, no dependencies.
