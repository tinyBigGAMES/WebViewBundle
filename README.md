#### 🚀 Description  
**WebViewBundle** is a lightweight Delphi framework that lets you package HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets into a single executable using the WebView2 engine. It works by embedding a ZIP-packed virtual file system directly into your EXE, and serves it using WebView2's virtual host mapping—no server, no installer, no dependencies.  

With WebViewBundle, you can:  
- 💡 Bundle your web app into a standalone EXE  
- 🧰 Embed assets as a compressed ZIP file  
- 🌐 Map virtual URLs (e.g., `app://index.html`) to embedded files  
- 🧩 Display your UI using Edge-powered WebView2  
- 🔒 Avoid runtime extraction or file I/O clutter  

It’s ideal for tools, dashboards, hybrid apps, and offline frontends.

#### 🔧 Key Features  
- 💼 Standalone .exe with embedded resources (will automatically install WebView2 runtime if not found)
- ⚡ Fast and memory-efficient loading from a stream  
- 🧩 Configurable startup page  
- 🌍 Clean separation of UI and logic  
- 🪄 Simple to use in any Delphi app
